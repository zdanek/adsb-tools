# adsb-tools
ADSB SBS-1 tools. Fake replay server, analyzer

## Replay server
Replays csv dump with respect to delays between incoming messages. Great for analysing ADSB diplay tools.

## Analyzer
Displays some useful information about incoming messages. Mostly callsigns and location. Ignores rest.


## Disclaimer
I'm not good Python programmer. I've used about 20 web pages with various snippets and examples to write this tool ;)
